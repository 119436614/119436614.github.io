		<h1 style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Travel</b></u></h1>
			<ul>
				<li><p>In the 21st century, travelling is becoming a very large aspect of life and at some point in time all of us will get the urge to travel around the globe.
					   I have already travelled around some parts of the globe, including some of Europe, North America and Asia and look forward to travelling around even more parts.</p>
					   
			<h3><b><u>Europe</u></b></h3>
				<li><p><b>Spain:</b> I have travelled to multiple parts of Spain from the usual tourist sunshine hotspots of The Canaries, Albufera and Malaga to the more touristy areas of 
							  a trip around Southern Spain in Seville, Granada and Rhonda. This trip around southern Spain was one of my favourite trips as you really got to experience
							  Spanish life from the unique varities of tapas to the scenery. It really was the trip of a lifetime.</p>
				<li><p><b>France:</b> This is another beautiful country that everybody must visit at least once in their lives. I have travelled around the North of France with my family seeing
				               the beautiful villages of Brittany along with continuing onto Paris and visiting Disneyland. A few years later we returned and travelled around Southern France
							   visiting places such as Carcassone, Montpellier and Nice. The cultures between North and South are totally different and that is what makes France so unique.
				<li><p><b>Germany:</b> Germany is full of different cultures, people and foods. It's based in Central Europe and you can tell how its different then France and Spain for example,
									   Instead of being savoury, tapas type food eaters, Germans eat heavy cakes, sausages and the likes as well as drinking beer over wine. While in Germany I visited Cologone,
									   Munich and Berlin. Cologone is the capital of culture in Germany and when I visited it was Oktoberfest and the athmopshere was brilliant. I would highly recommend
									   everybody to visit Germany!</p>
			<br />
			<h3><b><u>Asia</u></b></h3>
				<li><p><b>Vietnam:</b>&nbsp This is the only country in Asia that I have visited (so far). From the moment I stepped off the plane after the 10 hour flight, I knew that this was
											   going to be different then any trip that I had ever been on. The air was different in that it didn't feel as clean as European/North American air but you
											   quickly got used to it! When we reached Hoi Chi Minh City you were deafened by the sound at first only to realise that it was the hundreds of thousands of mopeds
											   that the civilians of Vietnam own. We stayed in Hoi Chi Minh for a few days before travelling up the coast towards Da'Nang and MeKong Delta which was gorgeous with
											   beautiful scenery and amazing boat tours. The food in Vietnam was some of the freshest I ever had, and would definitely recommend buying it off the fod stands if
											   you ever were to visit!</p>

<!--Text describing my favourite sports. Had to use <Strong> tags for bold text as </b> was causing a 'break' and going below the list item dot -->
	<div id="info1">
		<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Sports</u></b></h1>
		<ul>
			<li><p>I believe that sports are a very important aspect of every day life in that it encourages fitness and also allows for some social interaction between people
			   who otherwise might not have it. Sports allow for people to have fun while keeping healthy which is very important</p>
			   
				<li><p><strong>Tennis:</strong>&nbsp; This is a sport which I enjoy playing regulary. I play for a Tennis Club in Cork. We meet once a week for training where we are told how to improve
									 our shots and how to best play the game. Its also a great way to meet my friends after University. It's a great way to let your competitive side out
									 and you can go as hard or as easy as you want in tennis which makes it one of the more variable sports!</p>
				<li><p><strong>Hurling:</strong>&nbsp; This is one of Ireland's national sports and is also a sport that I really enjoy watching, even though I don't play it. Hurling matches always have a great
										   athmosphere in the stadium and shows the inter-county rivalry is alive and well. I watch nearly every match over the summer with my Dad and we always have
										   a really good time doing so. It is a very fast moving sport, one of the fastest in the world which makes it a very interesting game to watch.</p>
				<li><p><strong>Basketball:</strong>&nbsp; I played Basketball for a small while in Secondary school and really enjoyed the experience as it was a sport that I never thought of trying. I decided
												   to try out for the school team and enjoyed the experience so kept it up for around three years. I eventually gave it up but my interest in Basketball was spurred
												   and I watch the NBA every year now with some friends who were in a similar situation as I was. It's a yearly event now and we wouldn't have been friends if we hadn't
												   tried out for the basketball team so everything worked out in the end! </p>
