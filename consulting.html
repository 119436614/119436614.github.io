	<h3><u>HyperAutomation</u></h3> <!-- placing an image below the title in the center -->
		   <center><img src="consultingimg/hyperautomation.png" alt="" width="150"
         height="150"></center>
	<p>As defined by Gartner, hyper-automation “deals with the application of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), 
	   to increasingly automate processes and augment humans. Hyper-automation extends across a range of tools that can be automated, but also refers to the sophistication of the automation 
	   (i.e., discover, analyse, design, automate, measure, monitor, reassess.)” </br></br>
	   In simple terms, hyper-automation refers to the mixture of automation technologies that exist to augment and expand human capabilities. 
	   How is Hyper-automation Different from Regular Automation?</br></br>
	   When we think of automation, terms like robotic process automation come to mind. But, hyper-automation takes an ecosystem of technologically advanced tools 
	   and combines them to create a new way to work. </br></br>
	   It means that low-value tasks are optimally performed with automation tools, machine learning and advanced artificial intelligence so that outputs can be produced automatically and 
	   run efficiently with little to no human intervention. Then, together with humans, hyper-automation can create a workplace that is always informed, agile and able to use data and insights for quick and accurate decision-making. </br>

	<h3><u>Multiexperience</u></h3>
			 <center><img src="consultingimg/multiexperience.png" alt="" width="150"
         height="150"></center>
	<p>For the past decade of modern mobility (since the introduction of iOS and Android in 2007), enterprises have worked in parallel to transform web development for responsive, multichannel support and to ramp up mobile app development competencies. 
	   Over that time, technologies and practices have matured and converged, such as the common use of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and RESTful APIs, along with the adoption of agile methodologies and DevOps. Now the time has come to consider the merging of web and mobile development 
	   activities as “business as usual” for development organizations, and extend this to the next generation of user experiences.</br></br>
	   
	   Gartner has observed in client inquiries that organizations have broader requirements for use cases that involve developing experiences beyond that of just mobile or web apps. At the same time, we are observing technology changes in mobile app development platforms (MADPs) 
	   and in adjacent technology markets where development platform vendors are expanding their value proposition beyond mobile app and web development. This market evolution and platform expansion has resulted in the emergence of multiexperience development platforms (MXDPs) that 
	   are used for developing chat, voice, augmented reality and wearable experiences — as well as mobile and web apps — in support of the digital business.</p>
		
	   Application leaders must adopt an appropriate multiexperience development platform to create and support a plethora of digital user experiences. A MXDP offers professional and citizen developers a range of front-end development tools and back-end services that enable rapid, scalable development of seamless, targeted and ambient user experiences across devices and channels. 
	   Gartner recently published a “Tech Insight for Multiexperience Development Platforms” research note to introduce this concept to our clients.  We encourage client inquiries with the authors of this research to click <a style="color:blue;" href="https://blogs.gartner.com/jason-wong/multiexperience-development-has-arrived/">here</a> to learn more!

	  <h3><u>Distributed Cloud</u></h3>
	  	   <center><img src="consultingimg/cloud.png" alt="" width="150"
         height="150"></center>
	  <p>Distributed cloud is the application of cloud computing technologies to interconnect data and applications served from multiple geographic locations.</br></br>

		 Distributed, in an information technology (IT) context, means that something is shared among multiple systems which may also be in different locations. 
		 Distributed cloud speeds communications for global services and enables more responsive communications for specific regions.</br></br>
		 
		 Cloud providers use the distributed model to enable lower latency and provide better performance for cloud services. Beyond the cloud provider context, two other examples of distributed cloud are public resource computing and the volunteer cloud.</br></br>

		 Public resource computing is a cross between cloud computing and distributed computing that involves computers in geographically dispersed locations connected to collaborate on compute-intensive and/or computer-intensive tasks. Some examples of this are Folding@home, BOINC and SETI@home. 
	     In a volunteer cloud, the resources of member computers are connected through a single service or hub to collaboratively construct and configure cloud infrastructure. </br>
