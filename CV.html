		<div id="text">
			My Name is Darragh McGee. I am 19 years old and I am from Cork City. I'm currently in First Year in UCC </br>
			studying BIS. I am really enjoying the course so far and find it very interesting and enjoyable. I do have</br>
			interests and hobbies, some of which include IT. </br></br>
				
			My favourite part of IT would be mobile software development
			I have worked with a few companies in the US to help develop their products such as Nextbit who were then purchased
			by Razer Inc. I helped them to develop their actual mobile devices and I also beta tested their software during
			production to iron out any bugs</br></br>
		
			I also enjoy making software for Android devices. I update older phones to the latest versions of Android and make them</br>
			work like new. I distribute this software online where other users can update their devices which the manufacturers have</br>
			have discontinued updates for.
