		<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b><u>About Me</u></b></h3>
			<p>My Name is Darragh McGee. I am 19 years old and I am from Cork City. I'm currently in First Year in UCC <br />
			studying BIS. I am really enjoying the course so far and find it very interesting and enjoyable. I do have<br />
			interests and hobbies, some of which include IT. <br /><br />
				
			My favourite part of IT would be mobile software development
			I have worked with a few companies in the US to help develop their products such as Nextbit who were then purchased
			by Razer Inc. I helped them to develop their actual mobile devices and I also beta tested their software during
			production to iron out any bugs<br /><br />
		
			I also enjoy making software for Android devices. I update older phones to the latest versions of Android and make them<br />
			work like new. I distribute this software online where other users can update their devices which the manufacturers have<br />
			have discontinued updates for.</p>
	<br />
